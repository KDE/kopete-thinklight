== Issue ==

The plugin writes to and reads from the light's device file. By default, these
permissions are only given to root. Since kopete runs with normal user
privilliges, however, reads and writes would fail. Hence, the permissions of
the device file must be adjusted for normal users.

Since the device file lives inside the /proc space, permissions can't be
changed permanently (they are gone after a reboot). The solution is to execute
the helper program "kopete_thinklight_fixpermissions" whenever the thinklight
plugin is loaded, which gives ordinary users read/write permissions to the
device file. For this to work, the helper program needs to have the suid-bit
set.

== Solution ==

Please make sure the executable "kopete_thinklight_fixpermissions" has the
suid-bit set.
